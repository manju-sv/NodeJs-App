Official Node.js Image: Used an official Node.js image from Docker Hub as the base image. In this case, we're using Node.js version 14, which is a Long-Term Support (LTS) version.

Set Working Directory: We set the working directory inside the container to /app to keep the code and application-related files organized.

Copy Package Files: We copy the package.json and package-lock.json files into the container separately. This allows Docker to cache the dependencies installation step separately from the application code, which is more efficient.

Install Dependencies: We run npm install --production to install the application dependencies. The --production flag ensures that only production dependencies are installed, which reduces the image size and potential security risks.

Copy Application Code: We copy the rest of the application code into the container. This includes all the application files and source code.

Expose Port: We use the EXPOSE instruction to document that the container listens on port 5000. This is the port that the Node.js application typically runs on.

Define CMD: We define the command that will be executed when the container starts. In this case, it's npm start, which is a common command to start a Node.js application.

To build a Docker image from this Dockerfile, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:

docker build -t node-js-getting-started .

This command will build a Docker image named "node-js-getting-started" based on the Dockerfile. You can then run a container from the image using docker run

=========================================================================================

Here's an explanation of this docker-compose.yml file:

Node.js Application (nodejs-app):

It builds the Node.js application from the ./node-js-getting-started directory.
Forwards port 5000 from the container to the host for accessing the Node.js app.
Depends on the Loki service for log collection.
Uses the Loki driver for logging and specifies the Loki URL for log forwarding.
Loki (loki):

Uses the official Grafana Loki image.
Exposes port 3100 for accessing Loki's web interface.
Mounts a local directory (./loki-config) containing Loki configuration files.
Specifies the command to use a custom configuration file.
Promtail (promtail):

Uses the official Grafana Promtail image.
Mounts a local directory (./promtail-config) containing Promtail configuration files.
Specifies the command to use a custom configuration file.
Grafana (grafana):

Uses the official Grafana image.
Exposes port 3000 for accessing Grafana's web interface.
Depends on the Loki service for log data.
Sets environment variables to install the Grafana Loki datasource plugin.
Mounts a local directory (./grafana-config) containing Grafana configuration files.
Before running this Docker Compose setup, make sure you have the following directory structure:

- Project_Directory/
  - docker-compose.yml
  - node-js-getting-started/ (Node.js application code and Dockerfile)
  - loki-config/ (Loki configuration files)
  - promtail-config/ (Promtail configuration files)
  - grafana-config/ (Grafana configuration files)

To start the services, navigate to your project directory and run:


docker-compose up

Once the services are running, you can access the Node.js application at 
http://localhost:5000, 
Loki : http://localhost:3100, 
Grafana : http://localhost:3000.  
need to configure Grafana with Loki as a data source to visualize the logs collected by Promtail and stored in Loki.
