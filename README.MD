Official Node.js Image: Used an official Node.js image from Docker Hub as the base image. In this case, we're using Node.js version 14, which is a Long-Term Support (LTS) version.

Set Working Directory: We set the working directory inside the container to /app to keep the code and application-related files organized.

Copy Package Files: We copy the package.json and package-lock.json files into the container separately. This allows Docker to cache the dependencies installation step separately from the application code, which is more efficient.

Install Dependencies: We run npm install --production to install the application dependencies. The --production flag ensures that only production dependencies are installed, which reduces the image size and potential security risks.

Copy Application Code: We copy the rest of the application code into the container. This includes all the application files and source code.

Expose Port: We use the EXPOSE instruction to document that the container listens on port 5000. This is the port that the Node.js application typically runs on.

Define CMD: We define the command that will be executed when the container starts. In this case, it's npm start, which is a common command to start a Node.js application.

To build a Docker image from this Dockerfile, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:

docker build -t node-js-getting-started .

This command will build a Docker image named "node-js-getting-started" based on the Dockerfile. You can then run a container from the image using docker run
